Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

##How to Run
To run this arcade game, first download all necessary files, then open index.html in the web browser of your choice.

##How to Play
To move your character, press the appropriate arrow key to move in the desired direction. Collect gems and reach the water to gain points. Blue gems are worth 100 points, green gems 50, and yellow gems 20, while each time you reach the water you gain 100 points. However, collecting gems will also increase the enemies' speed. If you get hit by an enemy ladybug, you lose 100 points and a heart and get reset to the starting position. If you lose three hearts, you lose one of your characters. You have five characters, and losing all five will end the game.

Occasionally, one of the gems on the screen will be replaced with either a heart or a star. If you have less than three hearts, collecting a heart will add another heart to your current character, while collecting a star will slow the enemies down.
